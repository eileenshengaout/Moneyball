## MoneyBall Baseball Analytics 
In this project, my teammates and I took a dataset containing baseball statistics from major league baseball and used this dataset to find the best possible model that predicts the amount of games won by each team.

### Markdown File & Code 
The file "Final Project STAT 4230.Rmd" contains the R code, where we ran simple regression and multiple regression models, tested assumptions (constant variance, independence, normally distributed, linearity), and selected variables to find a model that predicts the amount of games won the best. 

### Downloaded PDF File of Report 
The file " " is our report of our findings. This report goes through the process of how we found our best model.
